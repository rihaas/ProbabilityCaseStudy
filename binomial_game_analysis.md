# Case Study: Analyzing a Probability Game

## Introduction

This case study examines a probability game involving drawing balls from a bag with replacement. We will analyze the likelihood of different outcomes and determine if participating in the game would be profitable or result in a loss.

## Game Description

A bag contains [mention the number] red balls and [mention the number] blue balls.

The rules of the game are as follows:

* You pick a ball, note its color, and **put it back** in the bag. This is done a total of 4 times.
* If all 4 times the ball drawn was red, you win ₹ 10.
* Otherwise, you lose ₹ 1.

## Question

Would engaging in this game result in a profit or loss for you?

## Problem Breakdown

* **Problem mentions that once you've noted the color, you put it back in the bag:** This indicates that the trials are independent, and the probability of drawing a red or blue ball remains constant for each draw.
* **What does this mean in the probability language?:** This implies we can use the binomial distribution to model the number of red balls drawn.
* **It means that the trials are independent with replacement.**
* **The step of taking out the ball is repeated 4 times:** This means the number of trials ($n$) is 4.

## Defining the Random Variable

Whether you end up gaining or losing will depend on how many red balls are drawn.

Therefore, let's define a random variable $X$ to denote the number of red balls drawn in 4 trials.

* $X$ is a discrete random variable.
* Possible outcomes for $X$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

## Probability of Success (Drawing a Red Ball)

Let $p$ be the probability of drawing a red ball on a single trial. Based on the information provided (assuming equal likelihood of picking any ball initially):

$p = \frac{\text{Number of red balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}} = \frac{[mention the number]}{[mention the total number]}$

Let $q$ be the probability of failure (drawing a blue ball):

$q = 1 - p = \frac{\text{Number of blue balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}} = \frac{[mention the number]}{[mention the total number]}$

## Binomial Distribution

The number of red balls drawn in 4 trials follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ and probability of success $p$. The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes (red balls) in $n$ trials is given by the probability mass function (PMF):

$$P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

Where $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.

## Calculating Probabilities for Each Outcome

We need to calculate the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 red balls.

* $P(X=0) = \binom{4}{0} p^0 q^4 = 1 \times 1 \times q^4 = q^4$
* $P(X=1) = \binom{4}{1} p^1 q^3 = 4 \times p \times q^3 = 4pq^3$
* $P(X=2) = \binom{4}{2} p^2 q^2 = 6 \times p^2 \times q^2 = 6p^2q^2$
* $P(X=3) = \binom{4}{3} p^3 q^1 = 4 \times p^3 \times q = 4p^3q$
* $P(X=4) = \binom{4}{4} p^4 q^0 = 1 \times p^4 \times 1 = p^4$

## Expected Value (Profit/Loss)

To determine if the game is profitable, we need to calculate the expected value. The expected value $E[X]$ is the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability. In this case, the "outcome" is the monetary gain or loss.

* **Winning Scenario (4 red balls):** Probability = $P(X=4) = p^4$, Profit = ₹ 10
* **Losing Scenario (0, 1, 2, or 3 red balls):** Probability = $P(X<4) = 1 - P(X=4) = 1 - p^4$, Loss = -₹ 1

The expected value $E[\text{Profit}]$ is:

$$E[\text{Profit}] = (₹ 10 \times P(X=4)) + (-₹ 1 \times P(X<4))$$
$$E[\text{Profit}] = (10 \times p^4) - (1 \times (1 - p^4))$$
$$E[\text{Profit}] = 10p^4 - 1 + p^4$$
$$E[\text{Profit}] = 11p^4 - 1$$

## Conclusion (Based on the Expected Value)

To make a decision, you need to calculate the value of $p$ based on the number of red and blue balls in the bag. Once you have $p$, you can calculate the expected profit using the formula $E[\text{Profit}] = 11p^4 - 1$.

* If $E[\text{Profit}] > 0$, then playing the game is expected to be profitable in the long run.
* If $E[\text{Profit}] < 0$, then playing the game is expected to result in a loss in the long run.
* If $E[\text{Profit}] = 0$, then the game is fair.

**[You can add further analysis here, such as calculating the specific probabilities and expected value once you know the number of red and blue balls.]**
