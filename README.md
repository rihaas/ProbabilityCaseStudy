# Probability Game Analysis

This repository contains a case study analyzing a probability game using the binomial distribution. The analysis includes both empirical (simulation-based) and theoretical calculations to determine the expected outcome of the game.

## Contents

* `casestudy.md`:  Detailed analysis of the probability game, including problem description, theoretical calculations, empirical simulations, and conclusions.

## Overview

The case study investigates a game where players draw balls with replacement from a bag containing red and blue balls. The goal is to determine whether participating in the game is likely to lead to profit or loss.

## Key Concepts

* Binomial Distribution
* Expected Value
* Empirical Probability
* Theoretical Probability
* Python Simulation (using NumPy)
